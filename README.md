# ForwarderInC
Message forwarding to Node using TCP/IP Sockets in C 
Execute initiatorNode.c on Node1 (it will act as client for Node2)
Execute forwarderNode.c on Node 2(acting as Server for Node1 and Client for Node 3)
Execute receiverNode.c on Node3 ( acting as Server for Node 2) 

Sequence

1) compile forwarderNode on Node2 and Execute Binary (Listening for Node 1)

2) compile initiatorNode on Node1 and Execute Binary 

3) compile recieverNode on Node 3 and Execute Binary (will be Listening for Node 2) 



first execute all the binaries (sequence not important ,but VM2,VM1,VM3)


On VM1

#start sending the message from VM1 

gaurav@ubuntu:~$ gcc initiatorNode.c -o i
gaurav@ubuntu:~$ ./i
Heyy from VM1


on VM2 it will be recieved and forwarded to VM3
gaurav@ubuntu:~$ ./f
In Parent process acting as client  to whom request will be forwarded
gaurav@ubuntu:~$ In child Process serving as Server for one of the client
Hey from VM1ï¿½




on VM3 msg sent by VM1 and forwarded by VM2  will be recieved 

gaurav@ubuntu:~$ gcc recieverNode.c -o r
gaurav@ubuntu:~$ ./r 
Heyy from VM1
